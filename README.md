# Convolutional Neural Network

This web app uses Python & JavaScript to implement a convolutional neural network built entirely from scratch using only numpy to map out a data set such that any character drawn can be recognised by the model.

Since the app uses no popular dependencies, it gave me a lot of insights into the math behind computational neural nets and intricacies of its optimal use cases.
